Named with deference to:

...But probably not as effective. :)

## Contributing

Open up a pull request and do whatever you want. We don't really have a much information about requirements, and the contest description explicitly mentions that we should expect the unexpected, so... I dunno. Code defensively, and be sure we always return a 200!

### A note on licensing

Licensing is still up in the air. I understand some contributors may not like the ones I've chosen. I picked these out of habit, because the combination of Apache 2.0 and MIT is kind of standard for the Rust ecosystem, but let me know (via the meetup group, my email, or via an issue here?) if you have concerns. On August 9, 2017, we'll settle the license thing in stone so that everyone who wants to contribute can without worrying about it changing.

I don't actually care what license we use. I only raise this topic because this was mentioned at the June meetup.
